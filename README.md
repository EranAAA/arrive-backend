# Arrive-backend - (on working projects) 

https://app-arrive.herokuapp.com/

The app idea is to provide a comfortable way to track my train and let the user know if the train is on time or expected to
be late. The idea came from my own experience running to the platform and finding that the train was late. 
My main challenge was to build a server that extracts the zip files from the location that holds the israel public
transportation data (GTFS) and upload to mysql server, and integrate them with the real time siri-sm api.
